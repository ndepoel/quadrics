\section{Introduction}

Quadratic surfaces are a simple, useful representation for certain types of curved objects, that can be used as building blocks for more complex models.
Examples of quadratic surfaces are spheres, cylinders and paraboloids. 
These shapes are difficult to render accurately using traditional rendering methods, because of limitations inherent to those methods.

In order to produce high-quality real-time renderings of quadratic surfaces, Christian Sigg et al. have developed a method for ray-casting quadrics
using programmable shaders on a GPU. 
We have studied the paper they have written about this technique \cite{sigg}, modified parts of it and created a custom implementation.
